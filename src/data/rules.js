        your balance.

        respectively.
        • You cannot touch your elbows or arms with your legs which deliberately supports the movement.

        movement of the bar.`,

        • The sum of weights successfully lifted in all the '6' rounds (i.e. 3 rounds of deadlift and 3 rounds 
        of squats) will be added and divided by the body weight of the lilter to calculate a ratio.
